Born and raised in Chittagong, I developed my passion for computer science during my undergraduate studies at Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology (CUET), where I actively participated in several programming competitions such as ACM ICPC. After graduating from CUET in 2019, I worked two years at AppsCode on Kubernetes related cloud technologies and contributed in several open-source projects. This experience prompted me to pursue graduate studies at Baylor University, where I was awarded a fully funded scholarship for Fall 2019 under the guidance of Dr. Tomas Cerny. My research focused on microservices architecture, software security, and code analysis, leading to the publication of five journal papers and ten conference articles. I completed my M.Sc. from Baylor in 2021 with the Outstanding Graduate Student award.

Since 2021, I have been working as a Software Development Engineer (L5) at Amazon, Tempe, Arizona, in the Customer Trust and Partner Support (CTPS) team. Here, I use my expertise in cloud computing, big data, and machine learning to enhance platform security and mitigate fraudulent activities.
